Different setup that builds two variants:

- one 'regular' (build/main) as in past editions of the course without any testing
- one 'testing' (build/main_test) with googletest enabled

With this setup students can switch the launch target in VS Code to either run the 'regular' version (main) or the 'testing' version (main_test).
